## We need all the support we can get

Creating games that are good enough to be published is hard, okay. We also want to make our games good enough to keep our fans hooked, and for that we will need your support. Please consider donating to our kickstarter [here](./index.md).

In the event that you cannot figure out how to run an installer, or are experiencing any bugs or glitches, please do not hesitate to contact us at:
