# World

In the world before time flowed, there were 6 gods in the making of the world.
Each god represented a different part of life:

- The first was Tag, who was the time before life, where stillness and death met 
to bring life into the world. He also holds ground over fertility, the world cannot
live without the fertility Tag brings.
- The second was Largo, who was the time when life grew and becomes independent,
when Tag ends and Largo begins is the time of birth and growth.
- The third is Eoden and represents the mature adult life, stories about her vary a
lot, but most say that she is a tired being that has many wrinkles on her forehead and hair greyer than the clouds on a stormy day.
- The fourth is Quor, who judges the old and brings Ondofna to power, without her, 
the old would never age and feel the pains of long life. Not all species have her 
blessing, such as the elves or the Dryads.
- The fifth was Ondofna, the one who brings death and stillness to the world,
without him, the sickly would suffer and the old would forever live. It is said
that Tag and Ondofna might be the same god.
~ The sixth has no name and cannot be percieved, usually called the invisible
god, the unnamed one (I like the sound of 'The Unnamed One') controls the cycle between the
parts of life. Without it, one would forever stay the same in both mind and body.
The cult that worships it has existed far longer than all others.

Life did not exist back when the gods lived, and they simply controlled natural 
cycles like the weather and seasons. This was until a demon from above lay a seed
to the ground, and from that seed grew green luscious plants and the first creatures.
This change in the cycle of the world hurt the gods considerably and they all 
fought for the right to own the strange occurence that wrapped the world.

From this war bore the mountains and oceans, volcanos and valleys, trenches and
ranges. And from this change in the world, so did the life they fought to own.
Then, the first human was born, and then the second, then the third and so on. Until
the human population in the world was 100 in which they finally gained recognition.
These beastly animals killed animals and offered them to the gods, which made all but
Tag and Ondofna mad. Ondofna blessed the humans with death and Tag blessed them with
birth, taught them the ways of the natural cycle. Then more demons came to the world
disguised as the humans which Tag and Ondofna loved.

The other gods warned them about the mischievous men behind the scenes, but Tag and
Ondofna were blinded from their love for their playthings and ignored the dangers, and 
they were killed for that. Not by the Demons nor the Gods, but the humans they loved.
Struck with rage, the other gods fought the Humans and Demons to avenge their brethren, 
but without Ondofna to grant death to either of them, the humans eventually suceeded in 
binding the gods to the world as regular beings that forever wandered. The demons, 
pleased by their success gave the humans a book filled with knowledge untold in this world
or the heavenly realm, and with this the humans learn of the skill to change the world as
they saw fit.


They called this skill Magic after their word for world *Mag* and their word for change *hik*.
Then for hundreds of years these humans lived and learn more of this Magic. Until Tag awoke 
and granted them the blessing of fertility, these humans who lived for so long without
birthing another were scareed of this new discovery and stopped their worldly indulging, but 
the damage had been done and they were now parents of a younger generation. Then Largo 
awoke to guide the young ones who now roamed the worlds and let them grow and learn. These
children, tired of their journey as wanderers split into two groups, one that would learn to be
strong and one that would learn magic. Both their goals were to live forever.

Then, Eoden awoke and the children grew into adults. The young ones who were in tune 
with the world rejected their worldly desires in order to learn, the ones who were in tune with 
death did not reject the temptations set upon them by adulthood and maturity and gave birth to 
more children who became even less in tune with magic. This happened for generations and 
interbreeding become dangerously close to each other, with the Wright family and the Honb group
being the largest groups. With several thousand men of weapons at their disposle, they waged war 
on the magic seekers.

History repeats and the weapon users were bound to the earth further and lost the ability to be 
skilled at magic from birth. Then the fourth stage of life awoke within them all, and the magic 
users, now realising the need to keep their group alive before they were unable to, gave birth to 
another generation who was even closer to magic at birth. These children were not as able to 
increase their potential and so they fought with the evolutionary traits they were born with to
become even stronger. The humans who were not in touch with the world grew old younger than ever 
with each generation. Unlike the magic uses, or elves, named so after their word for strong *ell* 
and their word for blooded *vese* who could live for 
centuries without growing old, the humans had just decades before being useless.

With more people reaching an age where they could no longer live a life of movement, the god of 
death returned from the grave and granted the blessing of death to all species, this was the cause 
of the great famine of old which brought every city to its knees. The city that got the worst of it was called [insert-name-here](#undeadpalace)
The elves were not given death in the same way as the humans were as they used the weapon granted to those who killed
Ondofna the first time. Instead they could only die if they were killed or ran out of magic, the one
thing they seeked to improve. Following suit was the fourth god who gave them the ability to age with 
the curse that when they age, they become more crazed with their search for knowledge, and became known as
'Daemons', eventually succumibing to rituals and overflowing magic power. It is said that every time an elf aged
to become a Daemon the world would become unstable.

(keep this)
The original humans were given the blessing of aging but not death as to curse them. Their species can 
now be found by those who seek the knowledge of the world and can make a reasonable trade for it. They 
live in the hollow cave of a tree larger than the tallest mountain (Ver. 2+) they bodies have rotted 
into skeletons that have been buried into the trees roots, the ones who witness them without significant
reason and purpose disappear forever from the world. It is said that their bones get added to the tree
itself and their skull can be found buried in the wall. For one to become a god, they must face the cave 
of the 100 and stand long enough to take in the words of the ancient beings. Concept art coming.

The elves, who grew distant in their beliefs of what would bring eternal life to them, changed their 
biology and become seperate races to suit the part of the world they would affect. The demons who grew 
worried about the humans returned to the earth and madenned those who lose their loved ones, making them 
invoke the blessing of Tag with animals. This was how the Demi-Hyuman (this is correct) species came to be.

The Demi-Hyumans were rejected by both humans and elves alike and had to grow by themselves in an unforgiving
world where even the gods turned their back on them, and so they went to the demons who granted them beauty 
and physical power without weapons. They then trained with their paws to build their own country of Demi
supremacy. Their country was under constant attack from humans because of the beauty in their nation. They then
went to the demons, asking for their beauty to be worsened a smidgen because they didnt want to have to kill their
family. The demons obliged and made the demi-humans a controversial species with humans, some woukd hate them 
and others would love them.

## Palace of the Undead

A parasite infected some food, which when eated, would cause the person to have sped up cell growth, this caused two 
things; Firstly, they would quickly become deformed fleshy monsters and secondly, the sped up cell growth in their 
brain would cause them to become hostile and unintelligent. The parasites eggs would also be stuck into the teeth 
of the monster, which would spread it to any food they ate.
